    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        "Hi, I'm [Mahendra Singh], a passionate web developer with a knack for creating dynamic and responsive websites.
        With a background in [Self Taught]], I specialize in building user-friendly web
        applications that solve real-world problems. <br>

        I have expertise in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m proficient in frameworks like
        React and Angular. On the back-end, I’m experienced with Node.js, Express, and databases such as MongoDB and
        MySQL. I also have a solid understanding of responsive design, version control (Git), and web performance
        optimization. <br>

        Over the past [2024/June], I’ve worked on a variety of projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to personal
        blogs and business websites. One of my favorite projects was [My Port Folio]. <br>

        When I’m not coding, you’ll find me [Playing Games]. I believe that continuous learning is key to staying ahead
        in this ever-evolving field, and I’m always excited to explore new technologies and methodologies. <br>

        I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to work
        together or just want to chat about the latest in web development!"
